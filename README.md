# NVIDIA-Stock-Predictor
This project aims to develop a predictive model for forecasting NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) stock prices using historical stock data. The dataset, which spans from 2015 to 2024, includes various features such as opening and closing prices, trading volume, and more. The project leverages Python, Pandas, and machine learning models to analyze the data and make predictions about future stock price movements.

Key elements:

- Data cleaning and exploration

- Feature engineering (e.g., moving averages, daily returns)

- Building a predictive model using regression and machine learning techniques

- Visualizations to analyze trends and patterns in the stock data

Tools & Libraries:

- Python

- Pandas

- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

- scikit-learn for machine learning models
